# Project Title

CostManager desktop application that allows its users to track their expenses. The application should allow its users the following operations:

1. Adding a new cost while specifying the category to which that cost will be added, the sum, the currency, and a small text describing that cost.
2. Adding new categories to a small list of categories that should be already defined.
3. Getting a detailed report that lists all costs in a specific period of time the user selects.
